## Research Work - Master's Thesis

#### 3D Reconstruction of Heritage Buildings

- Centered on developing a novel automated workflow for generating Level of Detail (LOD) models of heritage buildings in Montreal. This workflow incorporates both traditional and deep learning-based computer vision techniques and models.
- Extends to collecting UAV data, generating point clouds, and their subsequent post-processing. The dataset is soon to be open-sourced, aiming to facilitate further research in this field.
- Plays a crucial role in the conservation and digital twinning of heritage structures, aiming to contribute towards fostering a sustainable digital future.

#### Few-shot Learning with Limited Data: [Github](https://github.com/rucha97/few-shot-learning-PneumoniaMNIST)
- This project involved using a limited and arbitrary sample from the PneumoniaMNIST dataset.
- Assessed if combinations of augmentation techniques previously implemented increase the network's performance by data preprocessing and augmentation, integration of attention modules into a CNN model. 
- Applied transfer learning by finetuning different models achieved 3.45% accuracy improvement over benchmarking using AlexNet.

#### Facial Mask Detector: [Github](https://github.com/rucha97/mask-detector)
- Generated a new dataset of 4k images by collecting, pre-processing and performing data-augmentation of facial images.
- Trained and fine-tuned a CNN for facial mask detection and type classification.
- Eliminated bias and improved model performance using k-fold cross-validation.

#### Book Recommendation System: [Github](https://github.com/rucha97/book-recommendation-system)
- Developed a recommender using goodbooks dataset of 10k records to suggest books of interest and predict user ratings.
- Used Apache PySpark for Content-based and Collaborative Filtering approaches, including one-hot encoding and matrix factorization for latent feature identification.
